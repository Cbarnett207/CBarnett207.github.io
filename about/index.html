    <p><h3><span style="font-weight:normal">
      I am a master's candidate in the <a = href="https://geo.ku.edu/">Department of Geology at the University of Kansas (KU)</a>  
      where I am advised by <a href="https://stearns.ku.edu/">Dr. Leigh Stearns</a>, who heads the 
      <a href="https://geo.ku.edu/glaciology-and-remote-sensing-laboratory">Glaciology and Remote Sensing Laboratory</a>. 
      Prior to pursing my graduate degree at KU, I obtained my B.Sc. in Marine Science and a minor in Earth and Climate 
      Science at the University of Maine. During my time at the University of Maine I worked on a wide range of research projects 
      that were focused on using geophysical instrumentation for earth observations in both the marine and cryosphere settings. 
      My prior projects include both a multi-beam sonar bathymetric survey of the Bagaduce River Estuary system in Maine, and 
      multi ice-penetrating radar surveys along the Mathes, Llewellyn, and Tulsequah glaciers on the Juneau Icefield in Alaska.

      I am interested in using ice-penetrating radar in conjunction with various other remote sensing techniques to investigate 
      spatial and temporal changes along the base of ice shelves caused by oceanic forcing. My current research focuses on 
      using historic <a href ="https://icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA Operation IceBridge</a> radar imagery to investigate how 
      both submarine melt rates and basal crevasse morphology have changed over the last decade for ice shelves in both northern 
      Greenland and Antarctica. Quantification of ocean-induced submarine melt along ice shelves is critical for understanding 
      the dynamics of controlling outlet glaciers and the ice sheet as a whole. In conjunction with submarine melt, basal 
      crevasses act as first-order control on when and where discrete iceberg calving events can occur. Though submarine 
      melting and calving are understood to contribute to mass loss along ice shelves, the relationship and interactions between 
      these two processes is not well understood. Using new methods developed by our lab in conjunction with researchers at the 
      <a href="https://cresis.ku.edu/">Center for Remote Sensing and Integrated Systems (CReSIS)</a> at KU, my research addresses 
      the rate at which melt occurs along specific glaciers, and how melt impacts the growth of crevasses throughout time. Curious 
      about the specifics of my current and past research projects? You can find more information under
