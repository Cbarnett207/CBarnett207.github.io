  <div align="left">
    <p>
      I am a master's candidate in the <a = href="https://geo.ku.edu/">Department of Geology at the University of Kansas (KU)</a>  
      where I am advised by <a href="https://stearns.ku.edu/">Dr. Leigh Stearns</a>, who heads the 
      <a href="https://geo.ku.edu/glaciology-and-remote-sensing-laboratory">Glaciology and Remote Sensing Laboratory</a>. 
      Prior to pursing my graduate degree at KU, I obtained my B.Sc. in Marine Physical Sciences and a minor in Earth and Climate 
      Science at the University of Maine. During my time at the University of Maine I worked on a wide range of research projects 
      that were focused on earth observations in both the marine and crosphere settings.

      My prior research includes a multi-beam bathymetry survey 
      of the Bagaduce River Estuary system and and various ice-penetrating radar surveys in both Maine and Alaska
      
      I am interested in using ice-penetrating radar in conjunction with various other remote sensing techniques to quantify 
      spatial and temporal changes along the base of ice shelves caused by oceanic forcing. My current research focuses on 
      using historic <a href ="https://icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov/">NASA Operation IceBridge</a> radar to investigate how both 
      basal melt rates and basal crevasse morphology have changed over the last decade for ice shelves in both northern 
      Greenland and Antarctica. 
      
      Quantification of ocean-induced basal melt is critical for understanding the dynamics of controlling
      outlet glaciers
      
      Curious about the specifics of my current and past research projects? You can find more information under "research" tab on this website!
      
      
      
      Cody is a MS student studying glaciology and ocean-ice interactions. 
      Prior to arriving at KU, Cody studied geophysical application for earth observations in both marine and cryosphere 
      settings. His prior work included multi-beam bathymetry and ice-penetrating radar surveys in both Maine and Alaska, 
      respectively.
