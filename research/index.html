  <div aling="center"<h1>Research</h1>
    <p>Throughout my academic career my research interests have been varied between multidisciplinary projects within the oceangraphic 
      and cryospheric sciences. My current research focuses on quantifying complicated ocean-cryosphere interactions through observational
      remote sensing techniques. Using NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) radar depth sounder imagery, I compute submarine melt rates for ice
      shelves throughout northern Greenland. </p>
