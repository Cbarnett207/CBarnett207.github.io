        <div align="left"><p align="justify">Throughout my academic career my research interests have been varied between multidisciplinary projects within the 
            ocean and cryosphere sciences. My current research focuses on investigating poorly constrained ocean-ice interactions along Greenland 
            ice shelves using observational remote sensing techniques. Ice shelves are macro-scale floating extensions of marine-terminating 
            glaciers that are commonly found along ice sheet margins. The three most common mechanisms for mass loss along ice shelve are 1) iceberg 
            calving, 2) submarine melting via ocean water, and 3) seasonal surface ablation caused by surface melt and sublimation. While both calving 
            and surface melt are quantifiable via satellite remote sensing, melt along the undersides of ice shelves is not. Thus, for my thesis 
            research, I use repeat NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) radar imagery to quantify changes in ice shelf basal topography between sequential
            years. </p>
